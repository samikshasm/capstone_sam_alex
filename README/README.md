This week, we worked on getting the login screen working completely, populating the database with location every x minutes, and prompting notifications. 

The login screen last week consisted of a username and password field that would authenticate the user after checking the inputs against Firebase's Authentication Database. After our presentation last week, we had to change this since we didn't want the student using their email and also concluded that having a password is unnecessary. We will assign each user a "unique" username that they will use to login to the app. They will not require a password - we got rid of that field. Additionally, the Authentication Database will not contain the user's SLU email address - it will contain the unique participantID. Tracing back to the participant's name using this participantID will be hard so that gives us an additional layer of protection. We added code that checks to see if the user has previously signed into the app. This way, the participants won't have to sign in each time they open the app. We also created a sign out button and added code in our classes that allows the user to sign out. The login screen was time consuming but now it is finalized since we addressed all the concerns and features that came up last week.

The next thing we worked on is populating the databse with location updates (and time) every x minutes. This works now
