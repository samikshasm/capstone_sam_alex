# capstone_sam_alex

This week, we created and finalized all the screens on the app and tried to ensure that the app doesn't crash. Most of the week was spent on laying out all the UI elements on each screen and adding sign out and contact buttons. Since we had almost a week before the final presentation, we decided to add the morning report.

At the beginning of the capstone, the morning report was an extra feature we wanted to add if we had time - it wasn't part of the app's core functionality. Since we had time, we went ahead and created this report. We read from the database and display the number of drinks consumed, the total calories consumed, the number of liters drank, the number of locations changed, and the percentage of the consumption of each drink. The hardest part was trying to figure out how to read from the database. Since we wanted to extract specific data at a specific node in the database, we struggled with getting the information into the activity. 

As of right now, we have the entire app ready to go. We are having a few people test the app this weekend to ensure that we are not missing anything. This weekend, we plan on working on the final presentation, get a few answers from Dr. Shacham, and potentially meet with you before the final weekend to go away all the requirements.
