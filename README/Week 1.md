# README for Week 1 (Jun 5-11)

We sketched out the app screens with a detailed GUI that demonstrated the different processes that would take place in the app. The purpose of this was to show Dr. Shacham and make sure that we understood her requirements. After we met with her, we corrected our sketches by adding additional features and taking out the ones that she deemed unnecessary. 

Dr. Shacham also gave us more information on the local server she has. However, we decided to use AWS and Firebase after doing extensive research on the goal of this app. Since we want a secure database, Firebase would be the best route. We decided that to achieve the deliverables efficiently (and even thinking ahead to the second semester), Firebase would provide us with the resources necessary for secure data collection and retrieval, in addition to the ability to convert data to a web-facing portal in the second half of the capstone.

We also set up an Agile User Story board in Visual Studio where we mapped out all the user stories and created a Backlog that would allow us to reach our deliverables in an efficient manner. After meeting with Dr. Shacham, we prioritized certain tasks to be of a higher priority than others to make sure we have the core components of the app covered before we start adding other features. Right now, these user stories are broader but we decided that at the beginning of every week, we will go in and assign specific tasks to each person. 

We also created a GitHub repository and downloaded SourceTree on our computers to efficiently pull and push files. After several test runs, we were able to successfully push/pull, branch, and commit to the master repo. 

The next week (Jun 12-18), we are working on creating a network connection to the Firebase database. Once this is achieved, we will be creating the login screen that will allow users to login successfully with their unique emails and passwords.
